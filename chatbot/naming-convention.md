# Naming Convention

This document provides you the guideline on the naming convention best practices to apply for the:

- Intent
- Entity
- Event
- Context

Defining a good name for the Intent, Entity, Event and Context helps you to easily search it when needed, also to understand the purpose of each one of them.

## Naming Convention of an Intent

When naming an **Intent**, it is recommended to include the **action word** (i.e. verbs) as part of the **Intent Name** e.g. _inquiry_, _recommend_, _get_, _show_ and so on. 

The name of an Intent can follow the format: "**action_intent-purpose**" (**Action Name** followed by an **Underscore** and the **Intent's Purpose**, each word separated with a "-"). Below are some examples of **Intents** created based on the recommended naming convention. 

- **Inquiry**
  
  The Intent _inquiry_animal-pics_ is created to handle inquiries related to animals. It will show animal photos based on the user's preferred animal.  
    
  ![inquiry_intent_1](./images/naming-convention-images/inquiry_intent_1.png)

  The chat results for this Intent. 
  
  ![inquiry_intent_2](./images/naming-convention-images/inquiry_intent_2.png)

- **Recommend**

  The Intent _recommend_join-as-a-member_ is created to recommend the user to join the Animal Association as a member.   
     
  ![recommend_intent_1](./images/naming-convention-images/recommend_intent_1.png)
     
  The chat results for this Intent.
   
  ![recommend_intent_2](./images/naming-convention-images/recommend_intent_2.png)

- **Get**

  The Intents _get_visiting-day_ and _get_visiting-time_ are created to obtain the user's intended visiting day and time so that the Animal Shelter can book a visit session for the user.    
     
  ![get_intent_1](./images/naming-convention-images/get_intent_1.png)   
     
  The chat results for this Intent.   
     
  ![get_intent_2](./images/naming-convention-images/get_intent_2.png)

- **Show**

  The Intents _show_quick-menu_ and _show_help-menu_ are created to show the Quick Menu to the users. Users can then pick an option shown from the Quick Menu to continue with the conversation. 
    
  ![show_intent_1](./images/naming-convention-images/show_intent_1.png)   
     
  The chat results for this Intent.   
     
  ![show_intent_2](./images/naming-convention-images/show_intent_2.png)



## Naming Convention of an Entity

The name of an **Entity** has to be clear so that you can identify the **category of the parameter values** associated with the Intent.   
   
The name of an **Entity** can follow the format: "**category-name**" (each word in the Category Name separated with a "-").   

Below are some examples of **Entities** created based on the recommended naming convention. 

- The entity **animal-type** created to capture the value of the **Animal Type** mentioned by the user.   
   
  ![entity_1](./images/naming-convention-images/entity_1.png)

- The entity **day** created to capture the value of the **Day** mentioned by the user.   
   
  ![entity_2](./images/naming-convention-images/entity_2.png)

- The entity **time** created to capture the value of the **Time** mentioned by the user.   
   
  ![entity_3](./images/naming-convention-images/entity_3.png)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When adding entries under your entities, make sure the naming system is **consistent**. As you can see from the examples above, all of the entries under a single entity are either all in lower case or use pascal case. Please make sure that all your entries under an entity follow the same naming convention!


## Naming Convention of an Event

The name of an **Event** should explain on what the event does or the action it executes.   
   
The name of an Event can follow the format: "**_event_event-purpose_**" ("**event**" prefix to represent that it is an **Event** followed by an **Underscore** and the **Event Purpose**, each word separated with a "-").

Here's an example of an **Event** created based on the above naming convention. The Intent _show_help-menu_ has an **Event** item whereby when it is triggered, it will display the Help menu to the users:

![event_naming_1](./images/naming-convention-images/event_naming_1.png)   
   
The chat results for the Event configured in the intent.   
   
![event_naming_2](./images/naming-convention-images/event_naming_2.png)   



## Naming Convention for Context

_NOTE: To learn more on how to use Context, refer to [this document](./getting-started.md) for the details._

When you need to **control the flow** of the user's conversation or **bring forward values** provided by the user into another Intent, you can use Context to achieve this.  

The name of the Context can follow the format: "**_context_action-or-purpose_**" ("**context**" prefix to represent that it is a **Context** followed by an **Underscore** and the **Context Purpose**, each word separated with a "\_" or "-").

Consider this scenario - the user asks when he can come for a visit to the Animal Shelter. Then, the bot asks the Day and Time that the user wants to pay a visit. Lastly, the bot confirms on the visit session based on the Day and Time value provided by the user.

There are two parts involved with the Context setup - the **Input Context** and the **Output Context**.   
Below is an example of the Context setup to manage the conversation as per the above example, with the naming convention in use:
