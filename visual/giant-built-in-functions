## GIANT's Built-In Functions

**Unique** - Counts the distinct values within the column chosen. For example, if the data contains multiple names, it only takes into account a unique name once. This is particularly useful when wanting to know how many unique users exist in the consumer base.

**Count** - Counts the number of rows within a column.

**Maximum** - Takes the maximum value within a column.

**Minimum** - Takes the minimum value within a column.

**Sum** - Sums the numeric values within a column.

**Average** - Takes the average value within a column.

**None** - Does not affect the column. Used when the current data is already aggregated.

**Group By** - Used to look at the data within different groups of the data. For example: **Sales by Store ID for different Age Groups**.

**Sort** - Sorts the data in Ascending/Descending order depending on the data type.

**Filter** - Allows choosing columns within the table to filter specific criteria for the data.
