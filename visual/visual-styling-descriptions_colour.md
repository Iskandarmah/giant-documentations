# Visual styling: Descriptions and Colour

## Introduction:

This guide will quickly brief you on how to use descriptions and colour when creating your charts.

## Example descriptions:

Using descriptions give context to both you and your target audience on what your chart is showcasing. Descriptions should be short and sweet but should also effectively summarize what your chart is trying to achieve. It is also helpful to use a description as it may remind you when presenting if you have a lot of charts to showcase. Your description may also help you explain things about your charts that the title cannot.

This shows the **Total sales within each region** as the title explains.

However, our description helps to show the purpose of our chart and why we created in the first place. This allows there to be additional key information that is useful when presenting to the target audience.

## Example colour:

Choosing colours heavily depend on what chart you are using. Giant already has some built-in colour schemes that it provides you with when choosing what colour you want your chart to be.

Click the **hamburger icon** at the top right of your screen and click the **Palette** option. You can then choose what kind of colour scheme you want to use.

Always choose a colour scheme that is bright, has many options and is different so you it is easier for the audience to read. This is important as it may be essential for your audience to distinguish the differences in your data represented by your chart.

**Important note**: Choosing colours is dependant on what chart you are using and what information you want to convey to your audience.
